This is my second attempt (hence also a restart) of going through Learn Ruby the Hard Way (the online book by Zed A. Shaw).
I made it to exercise 35 in my first attempt after skipping a few requirements or study drills (like the old-school word game that I was asked to play).
I worked hard, accruing over 26 hours of study time over the two and a half weeks that I studied.
However, I also started becoming impatient, alway tempted to skip more time-consuming study tasks, and at the same time becoming reluctant to move forward as the material got harder.

Below are the promises to my commitment to finish the book well.
I promise I will be patient by completing every thing that is asked of me; 
I promise I will work hard by putting in at least three hours every day, six days a week;
I promise I will FINISH the book no matter how long it will take.
