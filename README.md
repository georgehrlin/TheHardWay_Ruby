This is my second attempt (restart) of going through Learn Ruby the Hard Way (the online book by Zed A. Shaw).
I made it to exercise 35 in my first attempt after skipping a few requirements or study drills (like the old-school word game that I was asked to play).
I worked hard, but I started becoming impatient, alway tempted to skip time-costly study tasks, and at the same time reluctant to move forward as the material got harder.

Below are the promises to my commitment to finish the book well.
I promise I will be patient by completing every thing that is asked of me; 
I promise I will work hard by putting in at least two hours every day, six days a week;
I promise I will FINISH the book no matter how long it will take.
